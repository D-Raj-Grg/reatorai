## Understanding Outliers

### What is an Outlier?

An **outlier video** is content that performs significantly better than the channel's average performance. Specifically, ReatorAI identifies videos that receive **2x or more** the average views for that channel.

### Why Outliers Matter

Outliers reveal:
- **What resonates**: Topics and formats that work exceptionally well
- **Viral patterns**: Specific tactics that drive above-average engagement
- **Audience preferences**: What viewers actually want to see
- **Content opportunities**: Gaps you can fill in your niche

**Example:**
- Channel average: 50,000 views per video
- Outlier threshold: 100,000+ views
- Outlier with 250,000 views = **5x multiplier**

### How Outlier Detection Works

ReatorAI's outlier algorithm:

1. **Calculates baseline**: Average performance across last 50 videos
2. **Adjusts for recency**: Newer videos weighted differently
3. **Sets threshold**: 2x average views = outlier
4. **Labels videos**: Outlier badge with multiplier (e.g., "3.2x")
5. **Updates daily**: Re-calculates as new data comes in

### Outlier Thresholds

- **2.0x - 3.0x**: Strong performer, worth studying
- **3.0x - 5.0x**: Exceptional content, definite pattern
- **5.0x+**: Mega viral, rare opportunity

### What to Look For

**In Thumbnails:**
- Color schemes that stand out
- Text placement and sizing
- Facial expressions used
- Visual patterns across outliers

**In Titles:**
- Word count (typically 40-60 characters)
- Emotional words used
- Number usage
- Question vs. statement
- Brackets and emojis

**In Content:**
- Opening 3 seconds (critical for retention)

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Not every outlier should be replicated:**

- **Controversy for controversy's sake**: May harm brand
- **Clickbait with no value**: Damages trust
- **One-time events**: Not repeatable (e.g., "I bought X")
- **Resource-intensive**: Requires budget/team you don't have
- **Off-brand**: Doesn't match your positioning

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I replicate this ethically?
- Does this match my brand values?
- Is this sustainable long-term?
- Will my audience appreciate this?

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why isn't a high-view video marked as an outlier?**
A: If the entire channel performs well, a high-view video might still be below 2x the average. Outliers are relative to that channel's performance.

**Q: Video has no transcript**
A: Some creators don't enable captions. Try finding similar content from channels with transcripts, or use the video's visuals and title for analysis.

**Q: Analysis seems generic**
A: AI analysis quality depends on transcript quality. Videos with detailed transcripts get better analysis. You can also re-run analysis to get a fresh perspective.

**Q: Can I analyze non-outlier videos?**
A: Yes! Any video can be analyzed. Studying "normal" videos helps understand what separates them from outliers.
