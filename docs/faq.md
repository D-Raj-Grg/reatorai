## Videos & Outliers

### What is an "outlier video"?

A video performing **2x or more** above the channel's average views. These are the videos worth studying because they resonated exceptionally well.

### How is the outlier threshold calculated?

1. Calculate average views for last 50 videos
2. Account for video age (newer videos weighted differently)
3. Set threshold at 2x average
4. Videos above threshold = outliers

### Why isn't a high-view video marked as an outlier?

Outliers are **relative** to that channel's performance. A 1M view video on a channel averaging 2M views is not an outlier. A 20k view video on a channel averaging 5k views is.

### Can I adjust the outlier threshold?

Custom thresholds available on Enterprise plans. Default is 2x for optimal signal-to-noise ratio.

### How do I find outliers?

1. Go to Videos page
2. Toggle "Outliers Only" filter
3. Sort by outlier score, views, or date

### Can I analyze non-outlier videos?

Yes! Any video can be analyzed. Sometimes understanding "normal" performance helps identify what makes outliers special.

### What if a video has no transcript?

Some creators don't enable captions. Try:
- Finding similar content with transcripts
- Manually analyzing video structure
- Requesting creator to add captions

## Script Generation

1. AI analyzes source video transcript

## Best Practices

### How many channels should I track?

**Recommended:**
- **Beginners**: 3-5 channels in your exact niche
- **Intermediate**: 5-10 channels (mix of competition levels)
- **Advanced**: 10-20 channels (organized by watchlists)
- **Agencies**: 20+ per client/niche

Quality over quantity!

### How often should I analyze videos?

**Suggested routine:**
- **Daily**: Quick scan for new outliers (5 min)
- **Weekly**: Deep analysis of 5-10 videos (1 hour)
- **Monthly**: Strategy review and pattern analysis (2 hours)

### How do I get the best results?

1. **Track relevant channels**: Direct competitors and aspirational creators
2. **Focus on recent outliers**: Last 7-30 days most relevant
3. **Analyze patterns**: Look for common elements across multiple outliers
4. **Customize scripts**: Make them your own, don't copy verbatim
5. **Test and iterate**: Try different hooks and frameworks
6. **Track performance**: See what works for your audience

## Troubleshooting

### Why won't my channel add?

**Common issues:**
- Invalid URL format (must be complete YouTube channel URL)

- Already at channel limit
- Temporary YouTube API issue

**Solutions:**
- Verify URL is correct

### Videos aren't syncing

**Wait 5-10 minutes** for initial sync. If still not working:
