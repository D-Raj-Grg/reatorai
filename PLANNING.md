## Feature Prioritization Framework

### RICE Scoring Model

**RICE** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

- **Reach**: How many users affected? (1-10)
- **Impact**: How much value delivered? (1-10)
- **Confidence**: How sure are we? (0.5-1.0)
- **Effort**: Person-weeks to build (1-10)

### Feature Priority Matrix

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------|----------|
| Script Generation | 10 | 10 | 1.0 | 3 | 33.3 | P0 |
| Outlier Detection | 10 | 9 | 0.9 | 2 | 40.5 | P0 |
| Watchlists | 8 | 7 | 0.8 | 2 | 22.4 | P0 |
| AI Analysis | 9 | 8 | 0.7 | 4 | 12.6 | P1 |
| Custom Writing Style | 7 | 9 | 0.8 | 3 | 16.8 | P1 |
| TikTok Integration | 6 | 6 | 0.6 | 5 | 4.3 | P2 |
| Team Collaboration | 4 | 7 | 0.5 | 4 | 3.5 | P2 |
| Template Marketplace | 5 | 5 | 0.4 | 6 | 1.7 | P3 |

**Priority Levels**:
- **P0**: Must have for MVP (build immediately)
- **P1**: Should have post-MVP (build in Month 4-6)
- **P2**: Nice to have (build in Month 7-12)
- **P3**: Future consideration (12+ months)

### Feature Validation Process

Before building any feature:

1. **Validate Problem**: Do users actually have this problem?
   - Method: User interviews, surveys, support tickets

2. **Validate Solution**: Will this feature solve it?
   - Method: Prototypes, mockups, user testing

3. **Validate Business**: Will it impact our metrics?
   - Method: A/B tests, beta groups, analytics

4. **Build MVP**: Ship smallest version
   - Method: 2-week sprints, incremental releases

5. **Measure Impact**: Did it work?
   - Method: Feature adoption, retention, satisfaction

**Kill Features That**:
- <20% adoption after 60 days
- Don't improve key metrics
- Have high maintenance cost
- Users are confused by

## Final Thoughts

### Success Principles

1. **User First, Always**: Every decision should improve user experience
2. **Ship Fast, Iterate**: Perfect is the enemy of done
3. **Data Over Opinions**: Measure everything, trust metrics
4. **Focus is Power**: Say no to distractions
5. **Build in Public**: Transparency creates accountability and community

### What Good Looks Like (Month 6)

✅ 100+ active users who save 5 hours/week
✅ 10+ paying customers ($1K MRR)
✅ NPS > 40 (users love it)
✅ 50% WAU (users come back weekly)
✅ Sustainable growth (15% MoM)
✅ Clear product differentiation
✅ Healthy unit economics
✅ Strong founder conviction

**If we achieve this** → We have product-market fit and can scale
**If we don't** → We learn, pivot, or shut down gracefully

### Decision Framework

When faced with tough decisions, ask:

1. **Does this help users save time?** (North Star)
2. **Is this the simplest solution?** (KISS principle)
3. **Can we measure the impact?** (Data-driven)
4. **Does this align with our vision?** (Strategic fit)
5. **Can we maintain this long-term?** (Sustainability)

If 4/5 are "yes" → Do it
If 3/5 or less → Reconsider
